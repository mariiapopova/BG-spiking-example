# Spiking model of basal ganglia and brainstem circuits in context of freezing of gait during DBS.
This is a repository of my Master's project (Modeling the effect of deep brain stimulation on cortico-subcortical networks in Parkinsonâ€™s disease - investigation of new paradigms).

To run the code, run initial.py.

To enter the STN-DBS mode, comment out line 658 and uncomment line 659 in FOGnetwork.py. Currently the network is in STN+SNr-DBS mode.
